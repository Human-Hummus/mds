		h1{"MDS - Music Download Script"}
		p{`MDS does what it says on the tin: it downloads music! (or copies them from local files!) It's built using ffmpeg, yt-dlp, wget, and, of course, Rust!

		I made MDS because, while yt-dlp `i{can}` download a list (like a YouTube playlist) of songs, it doesn't know if a song is already downloaded until it sees the title on YouTube or whatever, and thus, every time you want to update your local folder, it must check every single page, which is slow and can get real spammy, if you've got a large playlist. 
Additionally, it's hard to make yt-dlp output multiple files with custom titles. Cover art isn't included with yt-dlp's outputted files, either, and you can't set your own cover if you don't like the pre-determined one. 
And what about local media? It'd be nice to manage `b{ALL}` songs with one file.

		This program can download many files at once, with custom covers and titles, and supports local media sources.`}
